# Bug Tracker Rules

1. **Only submit bug reports, nothing else!**  
Do not suggest features or ask questions here! This repository is for bug reports only.

1. **Do not duplicate existing bug reports!**  
Before reporting a bug, always search through the existing bug reports to make sure that your bug has not been reported already!

1. **Be specific about the bug!**  
Always include necessary details such as the steps to reproduce the bug! Just saying "Wurst doesn't work" doesn't help anyone.

1. **When reporting a crash, always include the crash log!**  
Crashes cannot be fixed without the crash log. You can find your crash logs in `%appdata%\.minecraft\crash-reports`.

1. **Make sure you are using the latest version!**  
If you are using an outdated version of Wurst, chances are that the bug you are experiencing has already been fixed in a later version.

1. **When attaching files, do not use external websites!**  
Just drag your screenshots, log files, etc. directly into the bug report. They will be uploaded to the GitHub Cloud and embedded in your bug report.

1. **Make sure that your bug report is properly formatted!**  
These bug reports use Markdown formatting, which is easy to mess up if you have never used it before. Always preview your bug report before you submit it!

1. **No spam, hate or excessive negativity!**  
This rule should be self-explanatory.

Violating any of these rules can get you banned from all Wurst-Imperium repositories. You have been warned!
